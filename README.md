# Western Governors University Unofficial Transcript and Test Scores
 Western Governors University and its state affiliates do not calculate a grade point average (GPA) or class rank.
 
 Grading System
 - Official Transcripts include six possible marks:
    - Pass: Certifies successful completion of a course of study. The student has demonstrated the required competencies by passing the final assessment with a grade equivalent of “B” or better or 3.00 grade points on a 4.00 scale.
    - Not Passed: Indicates that a student failed to complete a course of study in the time allotted. To meet program requirements, the student generally re-enrolls for the course of study in a subsequent term.
     - Requirement Satisfied: Recognizes that a student has satisfied the requirements of a course of study through alternate coursework that may not be directly transferred.
 􏰀   - Transfer: Signifies that the student has completed equivalent coursework or holds certifications or licenses that comply with Western Governors University transfer credit policies.
    - Withdrawn: Represents that the student was withdrawn from the university or course before term completion.
    - Dropped: Verifies that the course was dropped from term registration and is not included in attempted units.
